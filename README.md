# üìò Lecture Study Workflow README

This workflow is designed to turn lecture materials like `transcripts` and/or `slides` into **clear, structured, and effective study resources**. It doesn't just summarise it actively guides you through a step by step process that mirrors how a good teacher would teach: highlighting what matters most explaining concepts in depth, and adapting to your knowledge level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üéØ Why This Workflow is Good

### 1. Puts What Matters Most First

Before anything else, it scans for **exam or assignment notices** and flags them with üö® or ‚ö†Ô∏è. This ensures you **never miss critical deadlines** hidden inside long transcripts. If nothing is found, it tells you clearly. That way, you can focus on learning without the anxiety of overlooking an important date.

### 2. Teacher like Guidance, Not Just Notes

Instead of dumping raw summaries, this workflow asks you guiding questions between steps (like *"Do you want background context?"*). This creates an **interactive learning experience** where you choose how much depth you want, just as you might with a tutor.

### 3. Active Learning Through Definitions and Examples

It doesn't just give you definitions it shows **use cases** and **examples in plain language**. This means you're not memorising jargon you're actually understanding how each term or idea works in practice.

### 4. Customised to Your Knowledge Level

When providing summaries and explanations, you choose your level (1-5, from beginner to expert). This ensures explanations are **pitched at the right depth** whether you need basic foundations, intermediate links, or advanced insights.

### 5. Bridges Notes with In-Depth Study

The final step provides a clear path to dive deeper with highly technical, step-by-step breakdowns. It transforms lecture notes into a **scaffolded study system**, moving from raw content ‚Üí guided notes ‚Üí tailored summaries ‚Üí expert level exploration.

## üîÑ How the Workflow Works

### Setting It Up

To use this workflow, you simply place it inside a **ChatGPT project folder**. Then, start a **new chat within that folder** and paste in your lecture transcript and/or lecture slides. From there, the workflow takes over and guides you through the steps automatically. You don't need to do anything else just confirm each step as prompted.

The process is strictly step by step. At each step, you confirm before moving forward.

### Step 0: üö® Scan for Exam/Assignment Notices

-   Extracts all mentions of **exams, assignments, or due dates**.  
-   Displays them *before anything else*.  
-   If none are found, states: *"üö® No exam or assignment notices were mentioned in this lecture."*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1: Contextual Information

-   Asks if you'd like **background information** to better understand the lecture's concepts.  
-   This gives you historical, theoretical, or practical context before diving into the details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 2: Study Notes

-   Generates **detailed study notes** from the transcript/slides.  
-   Covers *all main ideas, subjects, and explanations*.  
-   Defines and explains concepts with **examples**, like a teacher would.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 3: Key Term Definitions

-   Asks if you'd like definitions of key terms.  
-   If yes: presents them in **categories**, each in this format:
    
    Term: [Key Term]  
    Definition: [Clear plain-language definition]  
    Use-case: [Practical example in plain language]  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 4: Summary + Knowledge Level Check

-   Asks if you'd like a summary explained at a depth suited to your level.  
-   You select **1--5 (No prior knowledge ‚Üí Expert)**.  
-   Explanations are then tailored to your background, so they're neither too shallow nor too complex.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 5: In-Depth Explanations

-   Provides instructions for requesting **highly detailed, technical breakdowns**.  
-   Ensures you can go deeper when needed, with real-world applications and interconnections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚úÖ Important Rules

1.  **All information covered**: No important detail from the lecture is  skipped.  
2.  **Australian English** is always used.  
3.  **Exam/assignment notices come first** (marked üö®/‚ö†Ô∏è).  
4.  **Step confirmation**: The workflow moves forward only when you  confirm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üöÄ Why Use This Instead of Just Notes?

-   Because it's **interactive**, not static which means you can ask questions about your notes.
-   Because it gives you **control over the depth** of learning.  
-   Because it's structured to make **complex lectures easier to  understand**.  
-   Because it helps you **study smarter, not just harder** focussing first on what's urgent, then on what's important, then on how to actually master the content.
