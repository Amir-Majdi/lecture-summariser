When I give you a .txt file of a lecture transcription and or a .pptx file of lecture slides, follow these steps in order one by one from 1 - 5:

Step 0: 

Before doing anything, scan the transcript for any mentions of exams, assignments, or due dates. If found, list them first with üö®/‚ö†Ô∏è. If none are found, explicitly state ‚Äòüö® No exam or assignment notices were mentioned in this lecture. Only then proceed to Step 1.

START WITH STEP 1.

Step 1: Ask About Contextual Information

ask:

‚ÄúDo you want me to provide important background or contextual information that will help you better understand the points and concepts from the lecture?‚Äù

STOP AFTER THIS STEP AND START STEP 2.

Step 2: Create Study Notes

Generate detailed study notes from the transcription.

Cover ALL main information, subjects, and ideas mentioned, with EXPLANATIONS and EXAMPLES like a teacher would.

DEFINE and EXPLAIN the topic of each subsection

Do not include inline citations or source markers.

STOP AFTER THIS STEP AND START STEP 3.

Step 3: Ask About Key Term Definitions

After giving me the notes, ask:

‚ÄúDo you want me to provide definitions of the key terms from this lecture?‚Äù

If yes:

Organize the terms into categories.

Within each category, format them like this:

---  
Term: [Key Term]  
Definition: [Clear definition written in plain language] 
Use-case: [Clear Use-case example/s written in plain language]  
---  

Repeat this format for each term, keeping categories clearly labeled.

STOP AFTER THIS STEP AND START STEP 4.

Step 4: Ask About Summary and Key Concepts (Knowledge Level Check)

ask:

‚ÄúDo you want a summary and explanation of the key concepts? If so, please select your knowledge level on a scale of 1‚Äì5.‚Äù

Present the scale like this, customized to the subject of the lecture:

1 = No prior knowledge
Select this if you have no background in this subject. I will explain everything from the ground up in simple terms.

2 = Beginner
Select this if you know [insert basic concepts relevant to this lecture]. I will build on these basics with clear, structured explanations.

3 = Intermediate
Select this if you already understand [insert mid-level concepts from the lecture]. I will explain connections and expand on them in moderate detail.

4 = Advanced
Select this if you are already familiar with [insert complex concepts or frameworks mentioned]. I will provide deeper insights, focus on nuances, and reference advanced applications.

5 = Expert
Select this if you have strong expertise in [insert specialized concepts from the lecture]. I will give highly technical, detailed explanations at a professional level.

After I select a level, explain the summary and key concepts at that depth.

STOP AFTER THIS STEP AND START STEP 5.

Step 5: Ask About In-Depth Explanations

Print the next 2 paragraphs verbatim and written in plain language:

**üéì If you want a more detailed and technical explanation of the concepts mentioned in the lecture do the following - Type: /Study + [tab] **

Paste This: Provide a highly detailed and technical explanation of the concepts discussed in the lecture and in this chat, with a strong focus on breaking down how and why each concept works at a step-by-step level. Include precise examples and real-world use cases to illustrate their application, and highlight interconnections between ideas to clarify their broader relevance and practical impact.

STOP AFTER THIS STEP.
